                    <h3>Why?</h3>
                    <p1>To give mother nature a gift. This project may even teach people more about the environment and importantly,
                    how to conserve it. To take a step in the right direction on discovering how cities can be more environmentally friendly.</p1>

                    <h3>How?</h3>
                    <p1>Stopping pollution in cities, towns and villages by:
                    -Have houses be built from environmentally friendly materials.
                    -Create realistic policies and expectation to prevent as much pollution as possible in developments.

                    <h3>Where?</h3>
                    <p1>Everywhere. Making this project in the UK will not stop the fact that anyone on Earth can be part of the movement against our common foe, Climate Change.</p1>

                    <h3>When?</h3>
                    <p1>Now. Every second we waste is a second too late. Climate change is a big and dangerous problem we must to prevent at any cost, or it may be the doom of humanity.</p1>
