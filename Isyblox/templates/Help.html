                <p1>We thank you. We includes Mother Earth and its over 7.5 billion inhabitants. </p1>

                <h3>Here's our simple list</h3>
                <p1><ul>
                    <li>1) Try not to use your vehicles as much. This simple statement has been said multiple times because it works. Try cycling or walking to work/study instead of using a personal vehicle, health, and the environment, What a combo!</li>
                    <li>2) We at Isyblox will give you a handpicked selection of charities you could donate to. Donating is an easy and fast way to support people who help the environment.</br></br>
                    <a href="https://teamtrees.org" class="btn btn-primary">Team trees</a>
                    <a href="https://teamseas.org" class="btn btn-primary">Team Seas</a>
                    <a href="https://support.wwf.org.uk/adopt-an-animal?utm_source=Google-Generic&utm_medium=PaidSearch-Generic&pc=AVN014003&gclsrc=aw.ds&ds_rl=1262365&gclid=CjwKCAjwq5-WBhB7EiwAl-HEkq9DC8sNK3dhUPibdN3tKJl7aE5L_QWZUOiMdMchBUBeSHqGuufzkRoCwzwQAvD_BwE" class="btn btn-primary">WWF</a></li></br>
                    <li>3) Sometimes it is unavoidable to not use vehicles, that is OK. However, it is much cheaper (and environmentally friendly) to use public transport. Economy of scale will simply work its magic and the Co2 emisions per person will be less.</li>
                    <li>4) Buy more energy efficient electronics. This quite an easy and obvious idea to implement many people forget to do it! Not only does it save the environment it also saves on the bills, quite efficient.</li>
